# Pixel maker
Third Udacity project to create an interactive pixel maker web page with Javascript and render it in HTML using CSS.

This was my final Udacity project on the [Introduction to Programming nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000).

The objective was to create an interactive web page, which allowed users to create a grid of any size (up to 25x25) and to colour individual cells.

### Starter code

Udacity provided starter HTML and CSS code in the course materials, with instructions to build the javascript code. 

If you have access to the Introduction to Programming course at Udacity, you can find a link to the starter code [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/82f18d18-0c75-4e6b-89ad-a659fbd21185/modules/36d97589-2a58-468d-a17f-94ca29039570/lessons/03ab9590-9a37-4797-ab0a-b9313561fc99/concepts/9c749ac2-1268-4e57-b2e4-6e8f5d77116d).
